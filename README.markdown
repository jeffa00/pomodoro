## This Project
This project aims to provide an open source HTML/CSS/JavaScript foundation for Pomodoro apps.

My goal is to keep the guts in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and then use build processes to create apps for:

* The Web (duh)
* Windows 8 Metro App
* Windows 7 (and Vista) gadget
* PhoneGap
    * iOS
    * Android
    * BlackBerry (maybe)
    * Windows Phone (maybe)
    * WebOS (maybe)

## Pomodoro Technique
As I mentioned above, your best bet is to hit the Pomodoro website for the straight scoop, but here's my short summary.

### What Is It?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique to help you get through tasks that require intense focus.

It does this by breaking your work up into 25 minute increments punctuated by 5 minute breaks. Every 4 work units, you take a longer break, typically 15-30 minutes.

### Why Is It Called Pomodoro?
Pomodoro is Italian for "tomato". Obviously tomotoes are the key to time. If mankind can crack their code, all of time will become our playground.

An alternate explanation would be that in Italy in the '80s it kitchen timers were sold that looked like tomatoes. Dude wanting to increase his ability to study medical school levels of info used said timer and named his process after it.

Yet another explanation might be that a time-travelling, interdimensional being known as "Captain Tomato", but in a Dr. Emilio Lizardo dialect found himself stranded in our dimension with it's one-way time-line. He created this technique to help train legions of followers who together could open a rift into his dimension and allow him to return home. He.. just wants... to go... HOME. Won't you help him?
